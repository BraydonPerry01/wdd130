        About Me:
        I am a web developer who loves to create and design web pages. I currently study at BYU Idaho Online majoring in web design. I plan to graduate with a bachelors in advanced technology. All of my work is done with the latest version of python. I use all of the knowledge that I have learned to create sites using HTML and CSS. After creating your webpage I make sure to validate all of my code in order to keep your site running at its full potential.
        I currently live in Cameron Missouri, but was born in American Fork Utah where I lived for the first 23 years of my life. My hobbies outside of work include but are not limited to gardening, cooking/baking, or any activity that can be done outside. I enjoy working outdoors, and tend to be barefoot so I can better ground myself to the earth.
