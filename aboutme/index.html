    <p> The degree path that I have chose was one that was completely spiritual led. 
    When it came time to choose a degree at the end of pathways I was a little scared 
    and unsure what field to go into. I then knelt down in prayer and asked with a 
    sincere heart just like the scriptures instruct to do. When I was finished I went 
    back to my computer and got the impressin to go into web design, so that is what 
    I have been focused on nand love every moment of it.</p>
    <p> Right now for work, I currently work in the kitchen at Red Robin. I have 
    always loved to cook and be in the kitchen. Not only is it a skill that I 
    developed, but I also love to see the looks on peoples faces when they try my 
    food. So far I have never recieved a complaint, only happy people with full 
    bellies.</p>
    <p> I have been a member my whole life, though I can't say that it has always been 
    easy.The older I get the more I am starting to actually pay attention to the things 
    that are being said and applying them to my own life. As for a favorite scripture, 
    I have always enjoyed reading 1 Nephi chapter 8. Since I was of a young age, I 
    always loved the symbolism and what it represents. </p>
